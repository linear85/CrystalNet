CrystalNet is a Python library that applies GNN to 
1. predict properties of crystal materials (mostly metalls)
2. accelerate the Monte-Carlo simulations for crystal materials.

The data.zip contains all the dataset for training and validation.

The folder training contains all the date for hyperparameter tuning, 10-fold CV, large-sample validation and training for crystal model.

The folder gnnMC contains all the data for the validation of the gnnMC model.
